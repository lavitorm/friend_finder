# About the FriendFinder app assignment
`FriendFinder` is a compatibility-based application. Essentially, a dating app. A full-stack site built with HTML5, CSS, Node.js and MySQL, that will take in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. Express is used to handle routing.The survey allows user to choose from a rating scale menu options to indicate how do they feel about each statement presented (in a total of 10).The survey uses a "likert scale". A rating scale often found on survey forms, that measures how people feel about something. It includes a series of questions that one can ask people to answer. In this case, the app offers 5 balanced responses people can choose from.
Screenshots can be found in the "pict" folder inside the repo and a demo version of the site can be viewed at https://friend-finder-fsf.herokuapp.com/ as a model/reference for how the app looks and operate.
